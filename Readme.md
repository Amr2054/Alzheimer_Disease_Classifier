## Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Risk Analysis
* Utilizes a trained **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the likelihood of Alzheimer's based on demographic, lifestyle, and clinical data.

### 2. PDF Report Generation
* Instantly generate and download a professional PDF summary of the assessment, including patient details and risk probability, suitable for medical record-keeping.

### 3. NeuroBot Assistant (Gemini Powered)
* A floating, intelligent chatbot powered by **Google Gemini**.
* Capable of explaining complex medical terms, offering health tips, and analyzing the specific data entered by the user in real-time.

### 4. Robust UI/UX
* **Dark/Light Mode:** Seamless theme toggling.
* **Smart Validation:** Prevents submission of erroneous data (e.g., impossible blood pressure values).
* **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile devices.
* **Interactive Health Tips:** Dedicated section for brain-healthy lifestyle recommendations.

## Usage Guide

1.  **Input Data:** Fill in the demographic and clinical fields manually.
2.  **Analyze:** Click **"Analyze Risk Profile"**.
      * The app will validate inputs and run the Random Forest model.
3.  **View Results:**
      * See the risk probability score and risk level (Low vs Elevated).
4.  **Download:** Click **"Download PDF Report"** to save the results.
5.  **Ask AI:** Click the **Brain Icon** (bottom-left) to open NeuroBot. Ask questions like *"What does my MMSE score mean?"* or *"How can I lower my cholesterol?"*.
