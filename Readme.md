## ✨ Key Features

### 1. 🤖 AI-Powered Risk Analysis
* Utilizes a trained **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the likelihood of Alzheimer's based on demographic, lifestyle, and clinical data.

### 2. 📝 PDF Report Generation
* Instantly generate and download a professional PDF summary of the assessment, including patient details and risk probability, suitable for medical record-keeping.

### 3. 💬 NeuroBot Assistant (Gemini Powered)
* A floating, intelligent chatbot powered by **Google Gemini**.
* Capable of explaining complex medical terms, offering health tips, and analyzing the specific data entered by the user in real-time.

### 4. 🛡️ Robust UI/UX
* **Dark/Light Mode:** Seamless theme toggling.
* **Smart Validation:** Prevents submission of erroneous data (e.g., impossible blood pressure values).
* **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile devices.
* **Interactive Health Tips:** Dedicated section for brain-healthy lifestyle recommendations.
